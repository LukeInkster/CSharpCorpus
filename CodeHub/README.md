## Contributing

Contributions are absolutely welcome. Unfortunately, Xamarin is a paid framework which makes it hard for contributors but if you'd like to create a PR I would be happen to test it. 

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D
