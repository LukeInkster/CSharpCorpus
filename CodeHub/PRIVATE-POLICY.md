# Private Policy

Last Updated: July 26, 2016

This document informs you of the policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information I, Dillon Buchanan (the "Owner" or "I"), receive from users of CodeHub (the "App").

I, the Owner, use your Personal Information only for providing and improving the App. By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## Information Collection And Use

The following describes the collection and use of data collected by the App.

### Error Logging

To reduce the number of crashes and error conditions the App will report stack traces to an AWS account owned and 
maintained by the Owner. The data extracted from the devices include the following:

- Error Message
- Error Stack Trace
- Application Version
- iOS Version
- Programming Method Name
- Terminal Error flag
- App Name
- App Navigation Path

The above are mostly self explanitory except for `App Navigation Path`. `App Navigation Path` refers to the internal App views that was navigated until the crash occurred.

No personal information is extracted during this process.

### Push Notifiation GitHub User

For users of the App's push notification feature, the user's OAuth token will be sent to a secure virtual private server maintained and operated by the Owner.
Upon recipt of the OAuth token, the user's name will be requested and their GitHub Notifications will be polled at a regular interval to generate the necessary push notifications - no other personal information is requested during this process.

At any time a user may disable push notifications from within the App and the OAuth token and username will be permanently deleted from the VPS instance. 
In addition, deleting the App or revoking the GitHub OAuth token granted to the App will remove the user's name and OAuth token from the VPS instance.

## Information Sharing

User information is not shared with any entity.

## Security

The security of your Personal Information is important, but remember that no method of
transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While I strive to
use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, I cannot guarantee its
absolute security.
