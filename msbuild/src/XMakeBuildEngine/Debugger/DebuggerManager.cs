    ///       this is at: Tools > Options  > Debugging > General, "Enable Just My Code".
    ///  - Use step-in (F11) between states.
    /// 
    /// 
    /// The general usage is to call:
    ///  - DefineState() for each state
    ///  - Bake() once you've defined all the states you need to enter.
    ///  - EnterState() / LeaveState() for each state.
